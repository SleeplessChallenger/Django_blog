<h2>Django blog with some features</h2>

- In this project I implemented simple blog with multiple features like:

	<ul>
		<li>Registration</li>
		<li>login</li>
		<li>Post addition/deleteion/view</li>
		<li>Account tweaking</li>
	</ul>

- Used Django built-in ORM to create models for User, Profile, Post and `sqlite` as bd

- For templates I used Bootstrap and some `css` to customize a little bit.

- Also take a look at `notes.txt` to explore my notes that can help you in Django stuff.
